You can check the frontend at [f1-dash](https://f1-dash-kappa.vercel.app/search), tho the backend is not hosted anywhere therefore it is down. For now if you want to the full functionning app clone this repo, and run it locally.

Dont forget to make a .env file in the frontend
```VITE_API_URL=your back end url```
